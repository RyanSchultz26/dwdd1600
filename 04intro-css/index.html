        <h1>Why We Workout</h1>
        <p>Exercise is key to a healthy life. Regular workouts improve physical and mental well-being, boost energy, and reduce disease risk.</p>

        <h2>Physical Benefits</h2>
        <p>Working out strengthens muscles, improves cardiovascular health, and enhances flexibility. It helps maintain a healthy weight and supports better sleep.</p>

        <h2>Mental Health Boost</h2>
        <p>Exercise releases endorphins, reducing stress and anxiety. It can improve mood and cognitive function, as seen in studies on <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exercise-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mental health benefits</a>.</p>

        <h2>Types of Workouts</h2>
        <p><strong>Exercise routines</strong> typically include three main components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cardio (e.g., running, cycling)</li>
            <li>Strength Training (e.g., weightlifting)</li>
            <li>Flexibility (e.g., yoga, stretching)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cardio burns calories and boosts endurance, strength training builds muscle, and flexibility prevents injury. Combining these creates a balanced fitness plan.</p>

            <dd>Aerobic exercises, like swimming or jogging, increase heart rate and improve stamina.</dd>
            <dt>Anaerobic Exercise</dt>
            <dd>Anaerobic exercises, like sprinting or heavy lifting, build muscle through short, intense bursts.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>There are several types of workouts you can try:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) alternates intense bursts with rest for efficient fat burning.</li>
            <li>Pilates focuses on core strength, posture, and flexibility.</li>
        </ul>
